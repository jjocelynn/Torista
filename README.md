# WikiGO

## Description

WikiGO is a JavaScript based web application that combines [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API's. Together, a travel website is created that provides users with relevant information based on the location searched. WikiGO offers curious users a way to learn more about the history of a destination whilst being able to see exactly where it is on the interactive map below.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

On page load, users are met with the WikiGO landing page. It features a clickable logo on the top left, an eye-catching display, and a search bar in the center. 

Once the user enters a location, their search history is saved and will be displayed under the search bar. Users have the option to clear history which will wipe previous searches from their local storage and pinpoints on the map.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

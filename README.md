# WikiGO

## Description

WikiGO is a JavaScript based web application that combines [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API's. Together, a travel website is created that provides users with relevant information based on the city that is searched. WikiGO offers curious users a way to learn more about the history of a destination whilst being able to see exactly where it is on the interactive map below.

## Usage

On page load, users are met with the WikiGO landing page. It features a clickable logo on the top left corner, an eye-catching display, and a search bar in the center. 

Once the user enters a location, their search history is saved and will be displayed underneath the search bar. This action initiates an automatic scroll function that brings the user to the main page content where they can view the Wiki article and map.

Notice a pin-point marker is placed at every location in the search history.
To use the map, users can click and drag to adjust the location and zoom in or out using their mouse's scroll wheel.

Users have the option to clear history which will wipe previous searches from their local storage and pinpoints from the map.
